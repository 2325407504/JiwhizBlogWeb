JiwhizBlogWeb
=============

An open source project to help you build a personal blog website in the cloud.

**This branch is under development!**

This application has been re-written with AngularJS, and I'm still learning...

You can try to run it inside STS by following the instructions at
[Running Jiwhiz Blog Locally](http://www.jiwhiz.com/post/2013/4/Running_Jiwhiz_Blog_Locally).

Please ask questions at [JiwhizBlog User Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/jiwhizblog-user-group).
